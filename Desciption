🖐️ Gesture-Controlled Presentation Tool with Hand Tracking
This project is an AI-powered, touchless presentation controller using computer vision and hand gesture recognition. It allows users to navigate and annotate PowerPoint slides in real time using predefined finger gestures. The system uses OpenCV and MediaPipe-based hand tracking (via HandDetector) to interpret gestures like slide navigation, drawing, pointer control, and color selection.

🎯 Features
👆 Navigate slides using finger gestures (next, previous)

✍️ Draw annotations on slides using your index finger

🎨 Change annotation color with intuitive finger combinations

🧼 Erase or clear annotations with gestures

📸 Live webcam feed embedded alongside the presentation

📂 Works with .pptx files using python-pptx

📦 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

python-pptx (for loading and displaying slides)

Custom HandDetector module (based on MediaPipe)

⚙️ Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python numpy python-pptx
# Make sure you also have the HandDetector module from the source
🚀 How to Run
Replace the presentation_file path with your .pptx file.

Ensure your camera is connected.

Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python gesture_presentation.py
Use gestures:

Thumb up → Previous slide

Pinky up → Next slide

All fingers up → Clear annotations

Index + Middle → Show pointer

Index only → Draw

Index + Middle + Ring → Erase

Index + Middle + Ring + Pinky → Activate color selection mode

Then:

Thumb only → Red

Index only → Green

Middle only → Blue

📚 Educational Use
This project demonstrates:

Real-time gesture recognition

Hands-free UI design

Integration of computer vision with interactive media

A practical application of human-computer interaction (HCI) techniques

⚠️ Notes
Ensure consistent lighting and a visible hand region for best results.

Requires the HandDetector.py module, typically implemented using MediaPipe or OpenCV landmarks.
